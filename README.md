### Basic square root implementation
- Uses a random number between 1 and the input
- Uses a while loop to find the square root with the random number
- Returns the square root for integer and perfect square roots

#### Issues
- Does not work for non-perfect square roots
- Does not work for negative numbers
- Does not work for 0
- Not optimized for memory
- Not optimized for speed
- Not omptimized for number of iterations

#### Run
`cargo run`
